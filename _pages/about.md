I am a PhD candidate at the <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://www.iitd.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India</a>. During my PhD, I have worked on several interesting research problems in computational spintronics and magnetism. You may want to visit [this page](/portfolio/) for more details on my research interests. The title of my PhD thesis is "Theoretical Insights to Spin Splittings and Texture in (Non-)Magnetic Materials".

I received a Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree in Physics from the <a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.iitgn.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India</a> in 2019, and a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Physics from the <a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.du.ac.in" target="_blank">University of Delhi, India</a> in 2017. I am a *Silver Medalist* in M.Sc. for my academic performance.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss my research further or share any of your own work. Let me know if you need access to any of my research article or any relevent data (input/output files, pre-post processing tools, etc.).
