title: "Spontaneous anomalous Hall effect in two-dimensional altermagnets"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/spontaneous-ahe-2d-altermagnets
excerpt: "This paper presents symmetry-guided design principles and first-principles simulations showing that two-dimensional altermagnets can exhibit spontaneous anomalous Hall effects (although symmetry requirements for 2D are more difficult than those of bulk altermagnets)."
